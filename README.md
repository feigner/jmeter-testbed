JMeter Testbed
==============

A simple seed of a JMeter test plan. A simple thread group rips through a list of URLs (urls.txt), making GET requests as fast as possible. A handful of samplers give a high-level overview of response times / throughput / latency / etc. Check the user defined variables for host / thread configurations.
